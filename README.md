Welcome to DSA Chronicles, where I document my journey through the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository will serve as a growing collection of notes, code snippets, and solutions as I explore various concepts, starting with Big O Notation.

<h2>What's inside?</h2>
Big O Notation â€“ A breakdown of complexity analysis, covering 9 subtopics to help understand the efficiency of algorithms.
Hands-on Coding â€“ Real-world examples and solutions in JavaScript to solidify each concept.
Progress Tracking â€“ Regular commits for each significant milestone, keeping the green streak alive ðŸŒ±.
<h2>Why this repo?</h2>
This repo is not only a learning journal but also a way to maintain consistency in coding and GitHub contributions. Each push represents a step forward in my DSA journey, helping me improve and build a strong foundation for web development interviews and beyond.
